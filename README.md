# sc-Coreset
Analyzing Large-Scale Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Using Coreset

1.  The core folder contain the implementation of sc-Coreset algorithm in MATLAB.

2.  The data folder contains an example large-scale dataset

3.  The matlab scripts folder contains all the files to compute the sc-coreset on both pca input data as well as raw data. You can
    change the dataset to run the same computation for different dataset  

4.  The python script folder usually run after the step-3 and used to produce figures presented in paper.
